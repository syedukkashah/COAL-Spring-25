You're absolutely correct about the alignment requirements for BYTE, WORD, and DWORD variables in x86 assembly:

- **BYTE (1 byte)**: No alignment needed; can be placed at any memory address.
- **WORD (2 bytes)**: Should be aligned to a 2-byte boundary (address divisible by 2).
- **DWORD (4 bytes)**: Should be aligned to a 4-byte boundary (address divisible by 4).

These alignment rules ensure efficient memory access and compatibility with x86 hardware, especially for WORD and DWORD, as misaligned accesses can cause performance penalties or, in rare cases, errors on certain systems.

I'll explain how these variables would be placed on the stack in your code, considering alignment, and provide a visualization of the stack layout. I'll base this on your most recent code, which uses a BYTE, WORD, and DWORD as local variables in a stack frame, and I'll show how to optimize the layout for proper alignment while keeping it compact. Then, I'll visualize the stack clearly.

### Context: Your Code
Your code allocates 8 bytes for local variables and stores:
- A BYTE (value 3) at `[ebp-1]`.
- A WORD (value 4) at `[ebp-4]`.
- A DWORD (value 5) at `[ebp-8]`.

The stack frame is set up with:
```asm
push ebp
mov ebp, esp
sub esp, 8
```
This reserves 8 bytes for local variables, and the variables are stored with:
```asm
mov byte ptr [ebp-1], 3
mov word ptr [ebp-4], 4
mov dword ptr [ebp-8], 5
```

### Current Stack Layout Issues
While your code works, the placement of the BYTE at `[ebp-1]` creates unused gaps (e.g., `[ebp-2]`, `[ebp-3]`, `[ebp-6]`, `[ebp-7]`), and the offsets aren’t optimally packed. To demonstrate proper alignment and a clean layout, I’ll:
1. Show the current layout (with gaps).
2. Propose an optimized layout that respects alignment and minimizes wasted space.
3. Visualize both layouts on the stack.

### Alignment Requirements Recap
- **BYTE**: Can be at any offset (e.g., `[ebp-1]`, `[ebp-2]`, etc.).
- **WORD**: Must be at an offset where the address is divisible by 2 (e.g., `[ebp-2]`, `[ebp-4]`, `[ebp-6]`).
- **DWORD**: Must be at an offset where the address is divisible by 4 (e.g., `[ebp-4]`, `[ebp-8]`, `[ebp-12]`).

Since the stack grows downward (lower addresses), local variables are accessed with negative offsets from `ebp` (e.g., `[ebp-1]`, `[ebp-4]`). The actual address is `ebp - offset`, so for alignment:
- WORD at `[ebp-N]` means address `ebp-N` must be divisible by 2.
- DWORD at `[ebp-N]` means address `ebp-N` must be divisible by 4.

### Current Stack Layout
Let’s assume `ebp = 1000` for clarity. The current code places variables as follows:
- **BYTE at `[ebp-1]`**: Address 1000 - 1 = 999 (no alignment needed).
- **WORD at `[ebp-4]`**: Address 1000 - 4 = 996 (996 ÷ 2 = 498, aligned).
- **DWORD at `[ebp-8]`**: Address 1000 - 8 = 992 (992 ÷ 4 = 248, aligned).

**Stack Visualization (Current)**:
```
Address | Content           | Notes
--------|-------------------|--------------------
1000    | (saved ebp)       | Pushed by push ebp
999     | BYTE (3)          | [ebp-1], no alignment needed
998     | (unused)          | [ebp-2], gap
997     | (unused)          | [ebp-3], gap
996     | WORD (4, high)    | [ebp-4], 2-byte aligned
995     | WORD (4, low)     | [ebp-5]
994     | (unused)          | [ebp-6], gap
993     | (unused)          | [ebp-7], gap
992     | DWORD (5, high)   | [ebp-8], 4-byte aligned
991     | DWORD (5)         | [ebp-9]
990     | DWORD (5)         | [ebp-10]
989     | DWORD (5, low)    | [ebp-11]
```
- **Total Space**: 8 bytes allocated (`sub esp, 8`), from `[ebp-8]` to `[ebp-1]`.
- **Alignment**:
  - BYTE: Fine at 999 (any address is okay).
  - WORD: Fine at 996 (divisible by 2).
  - DWORD: Fine at 992 (divisible by 4).
- **Issues**:
  - Unused bytes at `[ebp-2]`, `[ebp-3]`, `[ebp-6]`, `[ebp-7]` due to the BYTE at `[ebp-1]` and gaps before the DWORD.
  - The layout is functional but not compact, wasting 4 bytes.

### Optimized Stack Layout
To respect alignment and minimize gaps, we can rearrange the variables. We need:
- 1 byte for the BYTE.
- 2 bytes for the WORD (aligned to 2 bytes).
- 4 bytes for the DWORD (aligned to 4 bytes).
- Total: 7 bytes, but we’ll allocate 8 bytes to keep `esp` 4-byte aligned for Irvine32 library calls.

**Strategy**:
- Place the DWORD at the lowest offset (e.g., `[ebp-8]`) to ensure 4-byte alignment.
- Place the WORD next, at a 2-byte aligned offset (e.g., `[ebp-4]`).
- Place the BYTE last, at any offset (e.g., `[ebp-2]` or `[ebp-3]`), to fill gaps.

**Proposed Offsets**:
- **DWORD at `[ebp-8]`**: Address 992 (4-byte aligned).
- **WORD at `[ebp-4]`**: Address 996 (2-byte aligned).
- **BYTE at `[ebp-2]`**: Address 998 (no alignment needed).

**Modified Code**:
```asm
INCLUDE Irvine32.inc
.code
main PROC
    call myFunc
    exit
main ENDP

myFunc PROC
    push ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    sub esp, 8
    mov byte ptr [ebp-2], 3    ; BYTE at ebp-2
    mov word ptr [ebp-4], 4    ; WORD at ebp-4
    mov dword ptr [ebp-8], 5   ; DWORD at ebp-8
    movzx eax, byte ptr [ebp-2] ; Read BYTE
    call WriteDec
    call Crlf
    mov esp, ebp
    pop ebp
    ret
myFunc ENDP
END main
```

992     | DWORD (5)         | [ebp-10]
991     | DWORD (5, low)    | [ebp-11]
```
- **Total Space**: 8 bytes (`sub esp, 8`), from `[ebp-8]` to `[ebp-1]`.
- **Alignment**:
  - BYTE at 998: Valid (any address).
  - WORD at 996: Valid (996 ÷ 2 = 498).
  - DWORD at 994: Valid (994 ÷ 4 = 248.5, **misaligned**—see below).
- **Correction Needed**: I made an error in the DWORD placement. Let’s fix it.

### Corrected Optimized Layout
I noticed the DWORD at `[ebp-8]` in the optimized layout was listed at 994, which is incorrect. Let’s correct the offsets to ensure all alignments are perfect:
- **DWORD**: Needs 4-byte alignment, so place at `[ebp-8]` (address 992).
- **WORD**: Needs 2-byte alignment, so place at `[ebp-4]` (address 996).
- **BYTE**: Place at `[ebp-2]` (address 998) to minimize gaps.

The code above is actually correct, but let’s try a tighter layout to use exactly 7 bytes (1 + 2 + 4), though we’ll still allocate 8 for `esp` alignment:
- **DWORD at `[ebp-8]`**: Address 992 (4-byte aligned).
- **WORD at `[ebp-4]`**: Address 996 (2-byte aligned).
- **BYTE at `[ebp-2]`**: Address 998 (any address).

The above is fine, but let’s try packing even tighter:
- **DWORD**: `[ebp-8]` (992, 4-byte aligned).
- **WORD**: `[ebp-4]` (996, 2-byte aligned).
- **BYTE**: `[ebp-3]` (997, any address).

**Corrected Code (Tighter Layout)**:
```asm
INCLUDE Irvine32.inc
.code
main PROC
    call myFunc
    exit
main ENDP

myFunc PROC
    push ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    sub esp, 8
    mov byte ptr [ebp-3], 3    ; BYTE at ebp-3
    mov word ptr [ebp-4], 4    ; WORD at ebp-4
    mov dword ptr [ebp-8], 5   ; DWORD at ebp-8
    movzx eax, byte ptr [ebp-3] ; Read BYTE
    call WriteDec
    call Crlf
    mov esp, ebp
    pop ebp
    ret
myFunc ENDP
END main
```

992     | DWORD (5)         | [ebp-10]
991     | DWORD (5, low)    | [ebp-11]
```
- **Total Space**: 8 bytes allocated (`sub esp, 8`), but variables use 7 bytes (`[ebp-8]` to `[ebp-3]`).
- **Alignment**:
  - **BYTE at 997**: Valid (any address).
  - **WORD at 996**: Valid (996 ÷ 2 = 498).
  - **DWORD at 994**: Valid (994 ÷ 4 = 248.5, **incorrect again**—let’s fix the addresses).

### Final Corrected Layout
I made another mistake in the address calculation. Let’s do this step-by-step with correct addresses:
- Assume `ebp = 1000`.
- Stack grows downward, so `[ebp-N]` is at address `1000 - N`.
- We need:
  - DWORD: 4 bytes, address divisible by 4.
  - WORD: 2 bytes, address divisible by 2.
  - BYTE: 1 byte, any address.
- Total: 7 bytes, but allocate 8 for `esp` alignment.

**Optimal Placement**:
- Start with the largest variable (DWORD) to ensure 4-byte alignment.
- Place the WORD next to ensure 2-byte alignment.
- Place the BYTE last to fill any remaining space.

**Offsets**:
- **DWORD at `[ebp-8]`**: Address 1000 - 8 = 992 (992 ÷ 4 = 248, aligned).
- **WORD at `[ebp-4]`**: Address 1000 - 4 = 996 (996 ÷ 2 = 498, aligned).
- **BYTE at `[ebp-3]`**: Address 1000 - 3 = 997 (any address, fine).

**Final Code** (same as above, confirming correctness):
```asm
INCLUDE Irvine32.inc
.code
main PROC
    call myFunc
    exit
main ENDP

myFunc PROC
    push ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    sub esp, 8
    mov byte ptr [ebp-3], 3    ; BYTE at ebp-3
    mov word ptr [ebp-4], 4    ; WORD at ebp-4
    mov dword ptr [ebp-8], 5   ; DWORD at ebp-8
    movzx eax, byte ptr [ebp-3] ; Read BYTE
    call WriteDec
    call Crlf
    mov esp, ebp
    pop ebp
    ret
myFunc ENDP
END main
```

992     | DWORD (5)         | [ebp-10]
991     | DWORD (5, low)    | [ebp-11]
```
- **Alignment Check**:
  - **BYTE at 997**: No alignment needed (valid).
  - **WORD at 996**: 996 ÷ 2 = 498 (valid).
  - **DWORD at 992**: 992 ÷ 4 = 248 (valid).
- **Space Usage**:
  - Variables use 7 bytes: `[ebp-8]` to `[ebp-3]` (992 to 997).
  - Allocated 8 bytes (`sub esp, 8`), leaving `[ebp-1]` and `[ebp-2]` as padding.
  - The stack pointer (`esp`) after `sub esp, 8` is at 1000 - 8 = 992, which is 4-byte aligned (992 ÷ 4 = 248), satisfying Irvine32’s requirements.

### Comparison: Current vs. Optimized
- **Current Layout (Original Code)**:
  - BYTE at `[ebp-1]` (999): Fine but creates gaps.
  - WORD at `[ebp-4]` (996): Aligned.
  - DWORD at `[ebp-8]` (992): Aligned.
  - **Gaps**: `[ebp-2]`, `[ebp-3]`, `[ebp-6]`, `[ebp-7]` (4 bytes unused).
- **Optimized Layout**:
  - BYTE at `[ebp-3]` (997): Fine, reduces gaps.
  - WORD at `[ebp-4]` (996): Aligned.
  - DWORD at `[ebp-8]` (992): Aligned.
  - **Gaps**: Only `[ebp-1]`, `[ebp-2]` (2 bytes unused, due to 8-byte allocation).

### Why This Layout Works
- **DWORD at `[ebp-8]`**: Placed first to guarantee 4-byte alignment, as it’s the strictest requirement.
- **WORD at `[ebp-4]`**: Placed next, fitting perfectly at a 2-byte aligned address after the DWORD.
- **BYTE at `[ebp-3]`**: Placed last, fitting into the 1-byte gap between the WORD and the end of the allocated space. Since BYTE has no alignment needs, it can go anywhere.
- **8-Byte Allocation**: Ensures `esp` remains 4-byte aligned (required for Irvine32 library calls like `WriteDec` and `Crlf`), even though variables use only 7 bytes.

### Notes on Stack Alignment
- **Stack Pointer (`esp`)**: After `sub esp, 8`, `esp = 992`, which is 4-byte aligned. This is critical for function calls in the Irvine32 library, which assume a 4-byte aligned stack.
- **Padding**: The unused bytes at `[ebp-1]` and `[ebp-2]` are minimal padding to maintain `esp` alignment. If you only needed 7 bytes, you could try `sub esp, 7`, but this would misalign `esp` (993 ÷ 4 = 248.25), potentially causing issues with library calls.
- **Alternative**: If you want to use exactly 7 bytes without padding, you’d need to adjust the stack manually and ensure `esp` is realigned before calling Irvine32 functions, which is more complex.

### Output
The optimized code will still output "3" (the BYTE value), as the change from `[ebp-1]` to `[ebp-3]` only affects the stack layout, not the logic:
```
3
```

### General Principles for Stack Layout
When placing BYTE, WORD, and DWORD variables on the stack:
1. **Start with DWORDs**: Place them at 4-byte aligned offsets (e.g., `[ebp-4]`, `[ebp-8]`, `[ebp-12]`).
2. **Next, place WORDs**: Use 2-byte aligned offsets (e.g., `[ebp-2]`, `[ebp-4]`, `[ebp-6]`).
3. **Finally, place BYTEs**

Your question about why the values appear to be "repeated" in the stack visualization, specifically for `[ebp-8]` to `[ebp-11]` being the same value, is a great observation. This stems from how multi-byte values like a DWORD (4 bytes) are stored in memory and represented in the stack visualization. Let me clarify why this happens, explain the stack layout in your code, and address the apparent repetition, tying it to the alignment requirements for BYTE, WORD, and DWORD variables. I’ll also provide a clear visualization to make it intuitive.

### Context: Your Code and Stack Layout
Your code (from the most recent submission) sets up a stack frame with three local variables:
- A **BYTE** (1 byte, value 3) at `[ebp-3]`.
- A **WORD** (2 bytes, value 4) at `[ebp-4]`.
- A **DWORD** (4 bytes, value 5) at `[ebp-8]`.

The stack frame is created with:
```asm
push ebp
mov ebp, esp
sub esp, 8
```
This allocates 8 bytes for local variables. The variables are stored as:
```asm
mov byte ptr [ebp-3], 3    ; BYTE at ebp-3
mov word ptr [ebp-4], 4    ; WORD at ebp-4
mov dword ptr [ebp-8], 5   ; DWORD at ebp-8
```

In the stack visualization I provided, the DWORD at `[ebp-8]` appeared to have its value (5) "repeated" across addresses `[ebp-8]` to `[ebp-11]`. For example:
```
Address | Content           | Notes
--------|-------------------|--------------------
994     | DWORD (5, high)   | [ebp-8], 4-byte aligned
993     | DWORD (5)         | [ebp-9]
992     | DWORD (5)         | [ebp-10]
991     | DWORD (5, low)    | [ebp-11]
```

This repetition isn’t because the value 5 is stored multiple times but because a single DWORD (4 bytes) occupies four consecutive memory addresses, and the visualization breaks it down byte-by-byte for clarity. Let’s dive into why this happens and how it relates to the stack layout.

### Why the DWORD Appears "Repeated"
1. **DWORD Size**:
   - A DWORD is 4 bytes long. When you store a DWORD at `[ebp-8]`, it occupies 4 consecutive memory addresses: `[ebp-8]`, `[ebp-9]`, `[ebp-10]`, and `[ebp-11]`.
   - For example, if `ebp = 1000`:
     - `[ebp-8]` is address 992.
     - `[ebp-9]` is 991.
     - `[ebp-10]` is 990.
     - `[ebp-11]` is 989.
   - The value 5 (as a 32-bit integer) is stored across these 4 bytes in memory, typically in **little-endian** format (used by x86).

2. **Little-Endian Storage**:
   - In x86 architecture, multi-byte values (like WORD or DWORD) are stored in **little-endian** order, meaning the least significant byte is stored at the lowest address, and the most significant byte is at the highest address.
   - For the DWORD value 5 (`00000005h` in hexadecimal), the 4 bytes are:
     - `05h` (least significant byte).
     - `00h`.
     - `00h`.
     - `00h` (most significant byte).
   - These bytes are stored as:
     - Address 992 (`[ebp-8]`): `05h`.
     - Address 991 (`[ebp-9]`): `00h`.
     - Address 990 (`[ebp-10]`): `00h`.
     - Address 989 (`[ebp-11]`): `00h`.
   - When the visualization labels these as "DWORD (5)", it’s showing that these addresses collectively hold the single DWORD value 5, not that the value 5 is repeated.

3. **Visualization Breakdown**:
   - The stack visualization lists each address individually to show what’s stored at each byte.
   - For a DWORD, I labeled each of its 4 bytes (e.g., "DWORD (5, high)", "DWORD (5, low)") to indicate they’re part of the same 4-byte value.
   - The terms "high" and "low" refer to the byte’s position in the little-endian order:
     - "High" (lowest address, e.g., 992) holds the least significant byte (`05h`).
     - "Low" (highest address, e.g., 989) holds the most significant byte (`00h`).
   - This can look like "repetition" because the visualization splits one DWORD into four rows, but it’s just one value spread across 4 bytes.

4. **Same for WORD**:
   - The WORD at `[ebp-4]` (value 4, or `0004h`) is 2 bytes and occupies `[ebp-4]` and `[ebp-5]`:
     - Address 996 (`[ebp-4]`): `04h` (least significant byte).
     - Address 995 (`[ebp-5]`): `00h` (most significant byte).
   - The visualization shows:
     ```
     996     | WORD (4, high)    | [ebp-4]
     995     | WORD (4, low)     | [ebp-5]
     ```
   - This is one WORD, not two separate values.

5. **BYTE is Single-Byte**:
   - The BYTE at `[ebp-3]` (value 3, or `03h`) is only 1 byte, so it occupies just one address (e.g., 997) with no "repetition":
     ```
     997     | BYTE (3)          | [ebp-3]
     ```

### Corrected Stack Visualization
Let’s clarify the visualization to avoid confusion about "repetition." I’ll assume `ebp = 1000` and show the exact byte contents, emphasizing that multi-byte values span multiple addresses but represent one value. I’ll also include the hexadecimal values for clarity.

**Stack Layout**:
- **After `push ebp`**: Saves old `ebp` (assume some value, e.g., `12345678h`).
- **After `sub esp, 8`**: Allocates 8 bytes (`[ebp-8]` to `[ebp-1]`, addresses 992 to 999).
- **After storing variables**:
  - BYTE at `[ebp-3]` (address 997): `03h`.
  - WORD at `[ebp-4]` (addresses 996–995): `04h`, `00h`.
  - DWORD at `[ebp-8]` (addresses 992–989): `05h`, `00h`, `00h`, `00h`.

**Visualization**:
```
Address | Content (Hex) | Description                     | Notes
--------|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------
1000    | 78 56 34 12   | Saved ebp (e.g., 12345678h)     | Pushed by push ebp

997     | 03            | [ebp-3], BYTE (3)               | No alignment needed
996     | 04            | [ebp-4], WORD (4, low byte)     | 2-byte aligned
995     | 00            | [ebp-5], WORD (4, high byte)    | Part of WORD
994     | 05            | [ebp-8], DWORD (5, low byte)    | 4-byte aligned
993     | 00            | [ebp-9], DWORD (5, byte 2)      | Part of DWORD
992     | 00            | [ebp-10], DWORD (5, byte 3)     | Part of DWORD
991     | 00            | [ebp-11], DWORD (5, high byte)  | Part of DWORD
```
- **Key**:
  - The DWORD at `[ebp-8]` is one value (5, or `00000005h`) stored across 4 bytes: `05 00 00 00` (little-endian, starting at 992).
  - The WORD at `[ebp-4]` is one value (4, or `0004h`) stored across 2 bytes: `04 00` (starting at 996).
  - The BYTE at `[ebp-3]` is one value (3, or `03h`) in 1 byte.
- **No Repetition**:
  - The DWORD isn’t "repeated"; it’s one 4-byte value split across addresses 992–989.
  - The WORD isn’t "repeated"; it’s one 2-byte value split across 996–995.
- **Unused Bytes**: `[ebp-1]` and `[ebp-2]` (999, 998) are padding due to the 8-byte allocation (`sub esp, 8`) when only 7 bytes are needed (4 + 2 + 1).

### Alignment Check
As you summarized:
- **BYTE**: No alignment needed. Address 997 (`[ebp-3]`) is fine.
- **WORD**: Must be at a 2-byte boundary. Address 996 (`[ebp-4]`) is divisible by 2 (996 ÷ 2 = 498), so it’s aligned.
- **DWORD**: Must be at a 4-byte boundary. Address 992 (`[ebp-8]`) is divisible by 4 (992 ÷ 4 = 248), so it’s aligned.

The layout respects all alignment requirements:
- DWORD at 992: 4-byte aligned.
- WORD at 996: 2-byte aligned.
- BYTE at 997: No alignment needed.

### Why the Visualization Might Confuse
The confusion likely arose because I labeled each byte of the DWORD as "DWORD (5)" with qualifiers like "high" or "low" to show they’re part of the same value. This was meant to clarify that addresses 992–989 hold one DWORD, but it could look like the value 5 is stored four times. In reality:
- There’s only **one DWORD** (5) stored at `[ebp-8]`, occupying 4 bytes.
- The visualization breaks it into bytes to show the little-endian structure and memory layout.

### Reading the DWORD
When your code or a debugger reads the DWORD:
```asm
mov eax, [ebp-8]
```
- The CPU reads 4 bytes starting at address 992: `05 00 00 00`.
- In little-endian, this is interpreted as `00000005h` (5), so `eax = 5`.
- There’s no repetition; it’s just one 4-byte value.

Similarly, for the WORD:
```asm
mov ax, [ebp-4]
```
- Reads 2 bytes at 996: `04 00`.
- Interpreted as `0004h` (4), so `ax = 4`.

### Could the Layout Be Tighter?
The current layout uses 7 bytes (992–997) out of 8 allocated (992–999):
- DWORD: 4 bytes (992–995).
- WORD: 2 bytes (996–997).
- BYTE: 1 byte (997).
- Padding: 2 bytes (998–999).

To use exactly 7 bytes without padding:
- Place variables contiguously, but ensure alignment.
- Current layout is already near-optimal, but let’s try starting with the BYTE to see if we can eliminate padding:
  - **BYTE at `[ebp-7]`**: Address 993 (any address).
  - **WORD at `[ebp-6]`**: Address 994 (994 ÷ 2 = 497, aligned).
  - **DWORD at `[ebp-4]`**: Address 996 (996 ÷ 4 = 249, **not aligned**).

This fails because the DWORD needs a 4-byte boundary. The current layout (DWORD at `[ebp-8]`, WORD at `[ebp-4]`, BYTE at `[ebp-3]`) is optimal for alignment and nearly minimal in space. The 2 bytes of padding are necessary to keep `esp` 4-byte aligned (`sub esp, 8` sets `esp` to 992, which is divisible by 4).

### Alternative Visualization (Simplified)
To avoid the "repetition" confusion, here’s a simplified visualization that groups multi-byte values:
```
Address Range | Content       | Description                     | Notes
--------------|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------
1000          | 12345678h     | Saved ebp                       | Pushed by push ebp
999–998       | ??            | [ebp-1] to [ebp-2], unused      | Padding
997           | 03h           | [ebp-3], BYTE (3)               | No alignment needed
996–995       | 0004h         | [ebp-4], WORD (4)               | 2-byte aligned
994–991       | 00000005h     | [ebp-8], DWORD (5)              | 4-byte aligned
```
- **DWORD**: One value (5) at `[ebp-8]`, spanning 994–991.
- **WORD**: One value (4) at `[ebp-4]`, spanning 996–995.
- **BYTE**: One value (3) at `[ebp-3]`.

### Output Confirmation
Your code outputs the BYTE at `[ebp-3]`:
```asm
movzx eax, byte ptr [ebp-3]
call WriteDec
call Crlf
```
- Loads `03h` from address 997, zero-extends to `00000003h` in `eax`.
- Outputs "3" followed by a newline.

### Summary
- **No Repetition**: The DWORD at `[ebp-8]` is one 4-byte value (5) stored across `[ebp-8]` to `[ebp-11]` (addresses 992–989) in little-endian format (`05 00 00 00`). The visualization splits it into bytes, which might look like repetition but isn’t.
- **WORD**: Similarly, the WORD at `[ebp-4]` is one 2-byte value (4) across `[ebp-4]` to `[ebp-5]` (`04 00`).
- **Alignment**: The layout respects:
  - BYTE: Any address (997 is fine).
  - WORD: 2-byte boundary (996 is fine).
  - DWORD: 4-byte boundary (992 is fine).
- **Visualization**: Shows each byte to clarify memory layout, but multi-byte values (DWORD, WORD) are single values spread across multiple addresses.

If you’d like a different visualization style, want to experiment with a different stack layout, or have questions about little-endian storage or debugging this in a tool like Visual Studio, let me know!
