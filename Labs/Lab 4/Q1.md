# Assembly Code Corrections



```assembly
MOV AX, 3Dh    ; Corrected: Added missing comma and proper hex notation
MOV AX, 23     ; Corrected: Immediate value must be assigned to a register
MOV CX, CH     ; Corrected: Removed invalid syntax (`-` was unnecessary)
MOV AX, 1h     ; Corrected: Changed `MOVE` to `MOV`
ADD CX, 2      ; Corrected: Immediate values cannot be the destination
; ADD 3, 6     ; Error: Both operands cannot be immediate values (no direct fix)
INC AX         ; Corrected: `INC` only takes one operand (increments by 1)
